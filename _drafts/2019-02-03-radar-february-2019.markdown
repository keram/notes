### Art and Pleasure

 **[Elliptic Tales by Avner Ash and Robert Gross](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9665.html)**

[![Elliptic Tales Cover](/notes/images/2019-02-03-radar-february-2019/elliptic_tales.jpg)](/notes/images/2019-02-03-radar-february-2019/elliptic_tales.jpg)

Introduction to fascinating world of elliptic curves, number theory and contemporary mathematics.
It get's steep soon and I, I had to admit, had problems to follow. Nevertheless it was enjoyable and motivates me to study underlying math theory in future.

### Finance and Social

**FitBit Pay**

A very convenient way of paying and I don't need to carry a debit card.
I'm also lucky that my bank is one of the few if not the only one that it supports it in UK.<br/>
However, I can't rely on it 100% as after around fifty payments it suddenly refused to accept payment.
Which is bad as I did not have cash or debit card with me. This negates the main benefit and it happened twice already.
