## Highlights

### Health And Life

- **100% Dark Chocolate** / 42

    [![Montezuma's Chocolate](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/preview/100-cocoa-bar-with-orange-cocoa-nibs-absolute-black-p326-775_zoom.jpg)](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/100-cocoa-bar-with-orange-cocoa-nibs-absolute-black-p326-775_zoom.jpg)

    New guilty pleasure. Clear chocolate without sugar, last for a week
    and especially great with morning coffee.

    Favourites:

- **Smartwatch and Fitness Tracking** / 37

    It is interesting to see that although I feel that I spend in bed a
    lot of time, my actual sleep levels are very low. When it comes to
    steps and general activity plan is to keep it above 10_000 each
    month. One pattern to see is how I tried to exercise more in winter
    but then bank holidays and the start of spring had a negative
    impact. Still trying to recover from that.

    **Sleep Length October 2017 - June 2018**

### IT and Tech

{:.clearfix}
- **New Smartphone** /

    [![Xiaomi Mi A1](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/preview/mia1.jpg){:.ilustration}](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/mia1.jpg)

    Time to buy a new one. The battery in old one is completely dead and
    inacessible wi-fi at work makes it hard to connect with people.
    Current top choice:

    **[Xiaomi Mi A1](https://www.alza.co.uk/xiaomi-mi-a1-lte-64gb-black-d5124721.htm)**
    <br /> 5.5" 1920x1080, 4GB RAM, 64GB, 3080mAh battery, Android 7.1

    *pros*: price (~ £200), screen size, clean-ish Android,
    3.5jack

    *cons*: missing NFC, last year model, looks good on paper but
    real quality?

    Alternatives: wait for this year model (Mi A2), Nokia 7, ???


- **[Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition)** / 13

    [![Little Schemer](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/preview/little_schemer.jpg){:.ilustration}](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/little_schemer.jpg)
    An enjoyable introduction to programming, computability and Scheme
    language. Recommend to everybody unless you are trying to avoid eating
    biscuits.  For next few months, I have in plan go through the second
    book "Seasoned Schemer". Yay!

### Art and Pleasure

- **[Peckham Chamber Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/PeckhamChamberOrchestra/)** / 23

    [![PCO - Peckham Chamber Orchestra](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/preview/pco.jpg){:.ilustration}](/notes/images/2018-07-07-radar-june-2018/pco.jpg)
    Local amateur orchestra. Their sound sometimes can be rough, but
    actually some of the pieces they played sounded better than the
    version I found on youtube. Together with a venue (Peckham Liberal Club)
    it is a peculiar experience.

    Thank you, Hortense!

    One of the good sci-fi books I have read recently. We will see how the
    story unfolds in following books. (Credit Andrej)

    Summary from wiki:

    <cite>
    The Quantum Thief is the debut science fiction novel by Hannu
    Rajaniemi and the first novel in a trilogy[1] featuring Jean le
    Flambeur; the sequels are The Fractal Prince (2012) and The Causal
    Angel (2014). It was published in Britain by Gollancz in 2010, and
    by Tor in 2011 in the US. It is a heist story, set in a futuristic
    solar system, that features a protagonist modeled on Arsène Lupin,
    the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc.
