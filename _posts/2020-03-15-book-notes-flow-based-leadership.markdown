# Quotes

## -

Studies by researchers of flow, such as Mihaly  Csikszentmihalyi, Martin Seligman, and others, show that the more  experience and training a person has in a given area or task, the  more flow experiences that person will have.<br/>

## -

The goal of flow-based leadership is to establish and  maintain an organization that promotes the well-being of individuals  involved in the organization, as well as the customers or community  in which they serve.<br/>
When people can trust the organization to keep  their best interests at heart, they will be more forgiving when  things don’t go as planned.<br/>
There will always be factions who  disagree based on their own world view, but if the organization  consistently demonstrates and communicates its intentions as  honorable and true, those who disagree can still respect the  decisions made.<br/>

## -

Building an effective culture requires deligence, commitment, a  focus on safety, a servant-leadership orientation, knowledge  management, a sense of honor and duty to doing what is right and  true, a willingness to accept risk, thoughtful decision making, and  mindful communication

## -

we only grow when we are a bit off balance.<br/>

## -

Flow occurs when you face a clear set of challenging goals that  require appropriate responses.<br/>
Training, experience, and access to  feedback in the moment facilitate your decision making and your  actions.<br/>
You experience the feeling of complete and infinite  emersion in the activity.<br/>
Flow does not occur when you are at rest.<br/>

## -

being in a flow state does not guarantee the appropriate  decision, experience, or outcome.<br/>
Flow is neutral: that is, neither  positive nor negative.<br/>

## -

There are eight characteristics of flow:<br/>

• You have clear goals and are receiving immediate feedback  within the activity.<br/>
• There are many opportunities for decisive  action.<br/>
• Awareness and action merge.<br/>
• You focus on the task at  hand.<br/>
• You feel in control of your actions.<br/>
• Awareness of self  disappears during the task and feels stronger following task  completion.<br/>
• The concept of time has no meaning.<br/>
• The experience is  autotelic.<br/>

## -

Opportunities for acting decisively come from challenging  activities that require skill, which are matched by how well a  person believes he or she is suited for the challenge.

## -

according to Csikszentmihalyi, flow enables feelings of “the  possibility of control…what people enjoy is not the sense of being  in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult  situations.” The byproduct of feeling a sense of control is  confidence

## -

“It came from the experience of knowing, when you are in that  position, you cannot one hundred percent rely on the information you  get.<br/>
You have to use your gut instinct from your experience, so that  you can recover when something happens.”

## -

“We weren’t going to have it happen again.<br/>
Putting that policy  in place empowered the local folks to take the actions that they  needed to take

## -

Firefighters make no judgments about the “other.” What sets  firefighters apart is their compassion for other people.20 The  firefighter helps without prejudice or attribution.<br/>
There are no  labels placed on the people (or animals) in jeopardy.<br/>
Firefighters  are called to save lives.<br/>

## -

We were an open book right from the beginning.<br/>
This attitude  really helped us get through this.<br/>
Here’s what happened.<br/>
Here’s how  it went down.<br/>
Honesty is the best policy

## -

“Time is funny in emergency situations.<br/>
It compresses and  expands in very weird ways

## -

Autotelic refers to the idea that one acts for the sake of  doing.<br/>

## -

The feeling of being in flow is that of being at peace in any  activity.<br/>
It is that feeling of lightness, of moving without effort,  of buoyancy: as if flying through the air or floating in water.<br/>

## -

“When you are a fireman, you are doing your thing.<br/>
You worry  about you.<br/>
You worry about your partner, but it’s you.<br/>
As a fireman,  I want to go and dig out.<br/>
If it’s burning seventy percent of the  building, I want to go in there and ‘get me some.’ Once you become  an officer, it changes the whole scope.<br/>
Once you become battalion  chief and incident commander, you ask, ‘What’s my risk analysis  here? Is what I’m getting worth these guys?’ They might hate me  because I’m pulling them all out and going defensive, but as an  officer, it changes everything.”

## -

Flow occurs at the intersection of the activity’s challenge  level and our abilities to meet those challenges.<br/>
In other words, to  enter into flow, we have to balance challenges and skill at a high  level, while receiving feedback within and about the activity

## -

He simply wants to be the best he can be, on the job and in  his life in general.<br/>
He understands that he can always learn  something new in each class.<br/>
He actively seeks out new opportunities  to learn and excel.<br/>
He explained to me that once he has learned  something really well, he strives to challenge himself to go to the  next level.<br/>
In this way, he is always getting better, and enjoying  the job and his life more.<br/>
He is also appreciative of every  opportunity to expand his abilities

## -

intuition grows out of experience

## -

Preparation refers to training and experience.<br/>
It refers to  taking care of the tools of your trade.<br/>
It refers to  rehearsal—repeating the activity until it is ingrained at a cellular  level.<br/>
This is what enables recognition-primed decision making.<br/>
The  activity is so familiar to you that when you are challenged by  something out of the ordinary, you can continue to function at an  optimal level with confidence.<br/>

## -

Both physical strength and cardiovascular health contribute to  our sense of overall well-being.<br/>
Attention to physical fitness  through play and exercise is essential to our ability to initiate  flow states

## -

When people are in flow, they tend to lower their inhibitions  when stressed.<br/>
When they are stressed, strategies that worked in  the past may no longer be valid.<br/>
This allows for the consideration  of a variety of alternatives, based on perception and  cognition.<br/>
They reject the ideas that are not productive or  feasible, and select those that appear to work for the  situation.<br/>
Conversely, people with high levels of inhibition and low  cognitive ability shut down in the face of stress when in  intractible situations

## -

On a personal level, I have learned that if I go to the gym  early in the morning and work out for 45 minutes, I feel better  during the day.<br/>
My energy level is strong and my mind is sharp.<br/>
In  addition, there are the side benefits of lowering my cholesterol and  evening out my blood pressure, so that I don’t have to take  medication.<br/>
This enables my emotional and mental bandwidth to  expand.<br/>
I have “room” to put myself in challenging situations that  stretch my skills—one of the preconditions of flow

## -

The more leadership commits to training and preparation, the  more likely the leader’s team will experience flow when the  situation warrants it.<br/>

## -

Confidence is a function of training, experience, and  preparation in the form of physical readiness, mental alignment, and  spiritual connection.<br/>
To accomplish this, the individual must be  situationally aware at multiple levels.<br/>
When all these aspects are  in place, leadership happens—whether it is self-leadership or  leadership of others.<br/>

## -

High cognitive leaders are more in tune with themselves and  their relationships.<br/>
They recognize when they are communicating with  others who do not have the same level of cognitive ability, and make  the effort to ensure understanding in their communications.<br/>
People  with low cognitive ability “tend to use few dimensions when  processing stimuli…tend to contrast themselves with others and are  less open to feedback…[and] tend to have a relatively narrow set of  interests and knowledge domains

## -

Highly flexible people do not seek to predict and control  situations and events, but rather allow situations and events to  emerge, making decisions that are appropriate to the moment in  response to continuous feedback.<br/>
This correlates to the idea of the  merging of action and awareness that occurs in a flow state.<br/>
Leaders  rise out of the necessity for specific talents and knowledge  required in the situation

## -

We will be more likely to compare options when faced with an  unfamiliar situation.<br/>
The reason is that a lack of experience will  prevent us from generating reasonable options, or will at least  reduce our confidence in the options we do generate.58

We will be more likely to compare options when faced with an  unfamiliar situation.<br/>

## -

It is important to be aware of your feelings in each moment,  thereby minimizing potentially negative consequences.63 Therefore,  when you are able to imagine a positive outcome to life’s challenges  and incorporate experience and training to facilitate that imagined  outcome, you will be more likely to make choices consistent with  that positive image.<br/>
Your expectations can become “self-fulfilling  prophecies.”64 Bad decisions are most often made because of  “inexperience, lack of knowledge, or poor judgment.” The most  critical component of good, consistent decision making is learned  ability: knowledge, training, and experience coupled with the  awareness that everything is a system, requiring the continuous  processing of feedback and other information that may not  necessarily be available in a sequential manner

## -

“seven best practices—Awareness, Rest, Support, Exercise,  Nutrition, Attitude, and Learning (ARSENAL)—[to] build capacity in  these three key factors and contribute to developing and maintaining  a stress resilient system

## -

When you find yourself in a situation you don’t recognize, your  training enables you to focus on the unfamiliar elements of the  situation.<br/>
Training helps you execute those tasks that are necessary  to get through the situation, while freeing up your cognitive  ability to problem solve.<br/>
However, it is important to also factor in  the effects of stress, your ability and willingness to act, and  emotional and cognitive capacity.<br/>
If you or your organization is in  a constant reactive state of being, the abilities to focus on the  task at hand, to be open to possibility and creativity, and to act  appropriately for the situation are all compromised

## -

Experiences are not limited to personal experience.<br/>
When an  organization fosters knowledge sharing, you can learn from the  experiences of others.<br/>
This removes the time boundaries established  by linear experiences and facilitates exponential growth of everyone  on the team.<br/>
This requires fostering of a learning culture, free of  naming and blaming, and a commitment to life-long learning on the  part of individuals as well as the organization

## -

“True leadership is not about superiority, position, or  prestige.<br/>
It’s about revealing and releasing the potential of those  around you.<br/>
Leadership is not about the power of one, but  facilitating the greatness of many.” —Brett and Kate McKay

## -

Incident commanders and other commanding officers must  demonstrate the ability to lead by remaining calm; communicating  clearly, honestly, and concisely; and consistently making right  decisions.<br/>
Remaining true to this leadership style instills trust.<br/>

## -

If you are the person in charge on an incident, no matter  what your rank, you must be able to shift from a collaborative  leadership style to an autocratic leadership style in a  heartbeat.<br/>
This involves being secure enough in yourself to be  willing to make decisions that will upset or even anger those with  whom you are working

## -

Debriefing the incident upon immediate return to quarters is  essential to “reinforce good practices and…identify any unacceptable  performance.”

## -

impetus

## -

amorphous

## -

Empowering others to make the appropriate decisions instills  confidence and a sense of control, which is essential to operating  in flow.<br/>

## -

Knowing what type of leadership to use depends on training;  knowing when to use that type of leadership is facilitated by  experience.<br/>

## -

Smoke Daddy provides opportunities for instructors to share  themselves intellectually and spiritually.<br/>
He encourages instructors  to spread their individual passion like seeds in the  garden.<br/>
Instructors have the freedom to innovate and revise methods,  procedures, and motivation.<br/>
This fosters a sense of belonging and  contribution.<br/>
Rhodes says that this is the “life of the program.” In  the GSD program, you won’t ever hear anyone say, “That’s not my  job.”

## -

Recent research shows that “emotion and vividness influence  fluency, availability, and judgments of probability.”

## -

Drills are often based on past incidents in which firefighters  lost their lives in the line of duty.<br/>
This practice attaches an  emotional component and meaning to the drill that solidifies the  learning.<br/>
Knowing why reinforces the commitment to excellence.<br/>

## -

One of the biggest contributors to bad decision making in  emergent situations is fatigue.<br/>

## -

The Georgia Smoke Diver program represents a model of service  and community that can be duplicated successfully in other public  service organizations.<br/>
GSD is a group of equals, leaders committed  to service.<br/>
How the GSD program manages to sustain itself from year  to year has to do with member commitment to excellence and the  mission of the program: to make firefighters better.<br/>
After studying  them for the past five years, I have identified very specific  characteristics that facilitate their longevity, passion, and  dedication to their profession.<br/>
The following characteristics of the
GSD program form a framework for flow-based leadership:<br/>

• Lead by  example.<br/>
• Communicate clearly.<br/>
• Commit to a stable  infrastructure.<br/>
• Bind the group by cultivating trust.<br/>
• Honor  individual creativity for innovation.<br/>
• Use positive motivation  techniques.<br/>
• Facilitate team flow.<br/>

## -

there has to be commitment on the part of leadership at both  departmental and governmental levels.<br/>
The flow-based leadership  framework will not work in departments where leaders make fear-based  decisions, decisions that hurt others, or decisions that focus on  power.<br/>
Decisions must be based on love and respect for the job, the  professional community, and the community served

## -

organizational leaders in the business world, the  not-for-profit realm, and the public service sector often put  forward elements of this model.<br/>
However, leaders pick and choose  those elements that suit their own needs, which may be related to  financial gain, ego boosts, or power grabs.<br/>
What seems to be missing  is the sense of purpose, a sense of service toward the customer or  the public, and honor and respect toward the people actually doing  the work of the organization

## -

“Change-making happens when people fall in love with a  different version of the future.” —Seth Godin

## -

All ideas matter, even if not all can be implemented.<br/>

## -

make the effort to learn who your employees are at their core,  so that you can enable them to be successful.<br/>
People are happier and  more productive when they feel they are successfully contributing.<br/>

## -

If a person is in flow, he or she can and will work until the  task as complete: not because they have to, but because they want  to.<br/>
They enjoy the experience of getting it done.<br/>

## -

Empirical evidence over the last 20 years of organizational  studies shows that communicating a purpose, demonstrating trust,  encouraging and facilitating mastery, promoting self-management and  self-directed processes, and encouraging worker autonomy are the  most effective ways to motivate workers

## -

While this is best driven and demonstrated by the highest  leaders in the organization, each individual has the ability to  implement flow-based decision making using the components described  in this chapter.<br/>
You do this by:<br/>

• Demonstrating your own commitment  and ability to live and work in flow;
• Communicating your vision,  goals, decisions, observations, and ideas and giving others the  opportunity to communicate the same from their perspective;
• Mindfully providing the appropriate infrastructure and systems that  support and provide feedback to your people (rather than get in the  way of their ability to operate);
• Cultivating trust and a sense of  belonging;
• Honoring individual creativity;
• Using positive  motiviation techniques; and
• Learning what brings your people joy,  so that you can provide them with training and opportunities to be  in that space.<br/>

## -

In addressing ethical dilemas, the chief officer must  consciously recognize and define the situation, objectively identify  the facts, list all the options, compare each option to established  criteria, select the best option, double check the decision, and  take action

## -

two types of leaders:<br/>

(1) those who seek to control others, and
(2) those who lead by example, with the intent of enabling others to  operate from the best part of themselves.<br/>

## -

When leaders seek to control others, they quickly find that  those they lead will do only the bare minimum amount of work to get  the job done

## -

People who seek to honor and respect those they lead find that  people strive to do their best for themselves and their team.<br/>
The  leader sets and demonstrates the commitment to the  vision.<br/>
Creativity and critical thinking permeates everything the  team does.<br/>
This results in better service, less conflict, and a  higher sense of well-being at both individual and organizational  levels

## -

It doesn’t matter if an individual is on the lowest rung of the  organizational ladder.<br/>
He or she can exhibit leadership through  behavior, attitude, and effective communication

## -

Flow-based leadership requires that the individual take  responsibility for his or her own feelings, decisions, and  actions.<br/>
This requires a high level of self-awareness.<br/>

## -

Lolley took responsibility for his own preparation to reach  what he considered a worthy milestone.<br/>
The lessons he learned from  this experience have positively impacted his entire life

## -

The people who complete the training are both self-assured  and humble, which are by-products of feeling confident

## -

Communication is the master key to successful, effective  leadership.<br/>
Communication permeates every aspect of leadership,  whether it involves communicating with those who report to you,  communicating with peers, or communicating with those to whom you  report.<br/>
Communication can be verbal or non-verbal; it can be face to  face, or it can happen across communication systems.<br/>

## -

Communicate the Mission and the Vision.<br/>
People do their best  work when they understand why they are doing the work.<br/>
Why does your  organization exist? Your people, who contribute to the success of  the organization, will be more effective when they are moving toward  the same goals with the same intent.<br/>

## -

Every day of the class, the morning operational briefing occurs  at 6:30 a.m.<br/>
The briefing begins with a review of the mission and  objectives and why they are important: To prevent death and injury  by training firefighters to be adaptable and to develop critical  decision making skills in high stress environments.<br/>

## -

the Smoke Diver’s Creed whenever asked, often in high-stress  situations:<br/>
If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to  charge forward, I will succeed.<br/>
I will not hear those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious.<br/>
The prizes of life are at the end of each journey, not near the beginning, and it is not given   to me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my   goal.<br/>
I will never consider defeat, and I will remove from my   vocabulary such words as quit, cannot, unable, impossible, failure,   and retreat, for these are the words of fools and cowards.<br/>
When my   thoughts beckon my tired body homeward, I will resist the temptation   to depart.<br/>
I will try again.<br/>
I will make one more attempt to close   with victory, and if that fails, I will make another.<br/>
When others   cease their struggle, then mine will begin, and my harvest will be  full.<br/>

## -

The mission and creed are supported by the core values, which  are called “Nuts and Bolts:”

• Competence
• Honor
• Integrity
• Mental  toughness
• Servant leadership
• Commitment

## -

Communication is not just about words. It is about tone and  meaning

## -

The mandate is to remain calm, even when the world is on fire  and people are in trouble

## -

Remaining calm in the face of chaos is a skill, just like  anything else

## -

How a person connects with Source (whatever he or she calls  that Source) is a very personal thing.<br/>
The GSD program is difficult,  mentally and physically.<br/>
Participants break away whenever possible  to rest, contemplate, meditate, and pray.<br/>
This is not an organized  part of the program.<br/>
It happens organically.<br/>

## -

To be effective, we need to “understand the people with whom  we work and on whom we depend, and to make use of their strengths,  their ways of working, and their values

## -

It is every person’s responsibility to tell co-workers how he  or she prefers to receive information.<br/>
Conversely, it is also every  person’s responsibility to ask co-workers how they want to receive  information.<br/>
When we each take responsibility for how people prefer  to receive information and we honor that preference,  misinterpretation of communication will be kept to a minimum

## -

Individuals who actively practice self-awareness and who strive  to continuously improve their own interpersonal skills contribute to  the effectiveness of the team

## -

Having a sound infrastructure enables the ability to focus on  the changing environment without having to be concerned with tools,  systems, and other operational aspects being in working  order.<br/>
Organizations cannot expect the best work of their people  when the technology or the physical assets get in the way of  efficiency

## -

Components of Infrastructure

• Physical assets (buildings,  apparatus, computers, tools, and equipment appropriate to the types  of service to which the organization responds, personal protective  equipment [PPE], etc.).<br/>
• Systems (both systemic processes and the  supporting software that enables them).<br/>
• People to maintain and  support both the assets and the systems.<br/>
• Knowledge management  processes that support the activities of maintaining and operating  the infrastructure and the overall work of the organization (e.g.,  living documentation in the form of standard operating procedures,  after-action reports, and other decision-support information).<br/>

## -

Organizations that create such cold, monitored environments  convey to their workers that they are not trusted.<br/>
This establishes  an “us vs. them” environment in which no one enjoys working.<br/>
We  spend at least one third of our lives in the workplace.<br/>
The  workplace should be a place people want to be, where they enjoy both  the environment and the work they do

## -

When systems break down, what is your back up plan? Do your  people understand the command structure, and who is in charge of  what? Do they know what to do when their systems and equipment are  not working? Is there a protocol that they are supposed to follow,  and are they trained on this protocol?

## -

While it is practically impossible to imagine every scenario  that may need resolution, it is important to think of as many  situations as possible, put in place standard operating procedures  for handling these situations, and train both staff and personnel on  these procedures.<br/>
This effort should be done at a time that is not  emergent.<br/>
This is the essence of readiness.<br/>

## -

Internal Organizational Situation Awareness In the GSD program,  there are five standing meetings every day.<br/>

• At 6:30, the leadership  conducts the morning briefing with the instructors to go over the  day’s drills in the context of potential weather conditions, safety  considerations, and assignments.<br/>
• At 10:30, the leadership meets to  discuss tactics, review the next day’s activities, discuss any  problems that happened that morning while setting up, discuss  assignments for the next day, and change processes as  appropriate.<br/>
• At 14:00, the leadership team meets again to  recalibrate and discuss issues that need to be addressed.<br/>
• After the  class is finished for the day, the leadership team meets with the  instructors again to communicate any information pertinent to the  day’s decisions and the next day’s schedule.<br/>
• After the final  instructor briefing, the leadership team meets to prepare for the  next day’s morning briefing and discuss any last-minute  changes.<br/>
Meetings are not long.<br/>
They are designed to address issues  quickly, determine a resolution, make assignments, and decide how  the resolution will be communicated.<br/>

## -

While documentation projects are often attempts to capture how  the organization does it work, the resulting work product is often  no more than a snapshot in time

## -

Processes continually evolve because, unless there is forced  standardization, people will change the process to fit the  circumstance.<br/>
Why they make that change is what gets lost.<br/>
If this  tacit knowledge is not captured and codified, the organization is  doomed to repeat the same errant processes over and over

## -

infraction

## -

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are foundational to any  organization.<br/>
They spell out how the organization executes its  mission.<br/>
What many organizations do not realize, though, is that  SOPs are not static.<br/>
They should be living documents that reflect  the decisions of the leadership.<br/>
It is important to strike a balance  in the level of granularity within the SOPs.<br/>
If the organization  dictates every step of a process, maintenance of that SOP will be  much more difficult than if the organization offers guidelines on  how something should be done.<br/>
However, you don’t want to be so vague  that processes and procedures are not executed consistently.<br/>
Hiring  a professional technical communicator to help with this balance will  result in measurable dividends in the long run

## -

Another form of knowledge management is storytelling, although  this is less formal.<br/>
Some of the stories have been codified because  they are used as the basis for some of the training, such as the  Denver Drill.<br/>
Codifying these stories helps to anchor the facts,  which, in informal storytelling, tend to morph, expand, and  contract.<br/>
New elements enter the story, and over time, become  “facts.” Storytelling is an effective way to bind an organization to  its “ancestral” knowledge.<br/>

## -

Each person takes responsibility for his or her own work and  well-being, while also taking responsibility for communication with  others on the team.<br/>
This is what team flow looks like

## -

crestfallen

## -

Binding the group through a sense of purpose, accompanied by  the sense of mutual trust and support, fosters accountability.<br/>
The  glue for a bound organization is trust.<br/>
Cultivate trust with ritual,  storytelling, laughter, and collaboration.<br/>

## -

emotions help bind the group, and that making meaning out of  seemingly everyday moments builds trust and respect.<br/>
He knows  intuitively that ritual binds the group

## -

Chief Rhodes has a knack for saying just the right thing in the  right moment.<br/>
This is because he lives and breathes his own  commitment to live a life of service

## -

Laughter is the auditory equivalent of a hug of the grandest  proportions

## -

Storymaking and storytelling result in opportunities for  laughter.<br/>
Because the mission is so intense—literally focusing on  life and death—laughter is the logical and natural way to balance  the seriousness of the day

## -

Collaboration happens at the team level, as well as the  organizational level

## -

Honor Individual Creativity to Promote Innovation

## -

cognizant

## -

People feel motivated when their personal reason for being  aligns with the organization’s purpose

## -

Money and things are short-lived.<br/>
The joy associated with this  type of reward dissipates quickly, and is often replaced with a  sense of entitlement.<br/>
People come to expect the bonus or the trophy  and are upset when, even after doing mediocre work, they don’t get  it.<br/>

## -

According to Daniel Pink, “When contingent rewards aren’t  involved, or when incentives are used with the proper deftness,  performance improves and understanding deepens

## -

Many organizations have mentoring programs that serve this  purpose, but the success of these programs depends on individual  commitment by the mentors and consistency in how people are mentored

## -

People know when someone is genuine in his or her intentions  just by watching his or her behaviors

## -

Mentoring starts within the self.<br/>
We must be secure within  ourselves to mentor someone else.<br/>
This doesn’t necessarily mean that  we know everything; in fact, it means that when we don’t know the  answer, we are secure enough in our own skin to be able to say, “I  don’t know.<br/>
Let’s find out together.”


## -

meted out

## -

Shift to Positive Motivation Eventually, the tone of the  encouragement turns from “What makes you think you are good enough  to be here?” to “Come on.<br/>
You got this!” The shift is so subtle it  is almost imperceptible

## -

When a candidate isn’t stepping up or taking responsibility for  his actions, no amount of positive motivation will help

## -

Learn about your people at an individual level.<br/>
What are  their individual goals? What are their hopes and dreams? What are  they afraid of? Ask yourself how each person fits into the scheme of  things you have to achieve in your role as leader.<br/>
Does that person  need help? Would he or she be better served in another role? What  are his or her strengths and weaknesses on the team? What does he or  she love to do?

## -

Deliberately introduce variation to workflow.<br/>
Csikszentmihalyi  uses the example of how moving through a museum room to room fosters  boredom.<br/>
However, having people move through a connecting hall or  bridge with different views (e.g., the ocean, the mountains, the  city) will help the individual see the art in the next room with  fresh eyes


## -

Changing a culture and building a flow-based organization  requires vigilance, deliberation, and attention to detail.<br/>
Learn to  recognize when you have normalized unsafe practices for the sake of  tradition.101 Often tradition is perpetuated by ostracizing anyone  who is different or doesn’t conform.<br/>

## -

Firefighters know who they are at their core and understand  their life purpose and mission.<br/>
When you purposely live your life  with this knowledge, you live authentically.<br/>
You also take care of  yourself—not in a narcissistic way, but in a way that recognizes  that you cannot help others if you are not healthy in all aspects of  your life

## -

It often takes courage to express one’s own thoughts.<br/>
“Courage  is not the absence of despair; it is, rather, the capacity to move  ahead in spite of despair

## -

all forms of courage:<br/>

(a) physical courage,<br/>
(b) moral courage,<br/>
(c) social courage, and<br/>
(d) creative courage


## -

Creative courage is the most difficult of the forms of courage,  because it requires us to discover new meaning in the context of an  ever-evolving society

## -

The constant process of training, learning, and reviewing of  past incidents is how the firefighter exhibits creative  courage.<br/>
“The need for creative courage is in direct proportion to  the degree of change the profession is undergoing.”117 The fire  service profession is in a state of perpetual change
