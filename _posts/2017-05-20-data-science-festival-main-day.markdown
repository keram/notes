## Jay Liu - How can we predict a successful data science project


**Collaboration and sharing** will help you to discover, avoid mistakes or incorrect assumptions about the data in early stage of project.
One of the often mistakes that happens is collect large amount of data over period of time just to find out that they are useless because of flaw in methodology at the beginning.
