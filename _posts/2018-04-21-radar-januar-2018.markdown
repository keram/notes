## Highlights

### Health And Life

2. Zero TV series

Even I still rewatch some old episodes of MASH, Black Books or Fawlty Towers it was one of
the best decisions I did and stick to it. The disadvantage is that I don't get references
to the latest tv series like "Black Mirror" etc. but there are more important things in life.
Time is one of them.

4. Smartwatch and fitness tracker

Already first months of use showed some interesting statistics. 
For example my average active sleep is five hours

and do around seven thousand steps per month.

### IT and Tech

18. Pair Programming

It can be difficult to overcome personal fear or myths about efficiency but when it works
it gives higher satisfaction from work, while also helping to deliver on time higher quality solutions.
Kent Beck and Robert C. Martin provide useful tips on pair and "extreme" programming in general.
